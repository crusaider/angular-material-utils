## Project Structure

The repository consists of two distinct projects:

1. **ngmat-sorted-table-demo**: A demo and test application instantiating a SortedTable component. The app lives in `src/app`.
1. **ngmat-sorted-table**: A library implementing the actual npm package. The library lives in `projects/ngmat-sorted-table`-

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server running the test and demo app. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build library

Run `npm run build-library` whenever a change has been made to the code in the library. During development this has to be done for the test and demo app to pick upp any changes.
