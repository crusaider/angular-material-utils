## Project Structure

A set of projects:

**demos-app**: A demo and test application for all the packages in the repo. The app lives in `projects/demos-app`.

The separate packages lives in separate sub projects:

1. **ngmat-sorted-table**: `projects/ngmat-sorted-table`

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server running the test and demo app. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build library

Run `npm run build-library` whenever a change has been made to the code in the library. During development this has to be done for the test and demo app to pick upp any changes.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Packaging

Run `npm run package` to build the library and create a npm package ready for publishing.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the demo app unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `npm run test-library` to execute the library unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
